# Simple VPS - VPN
Set up instructions of a simple ssh connection to brows the web through a VPS.
This article contains instructions on how to set up a connection
to a Linux virtual private server in order to use it as a somewhat 
secure VPN to brows the web.  Its components consist of using a
Firefix browser, the FoxyProxy addon, and the PuTTY ssh client.
No VPN needs to be installed on the Linux VPS.

<b> PuTTY client here: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html</b><br>
